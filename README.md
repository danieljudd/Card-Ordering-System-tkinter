# Card-Ordering-System-tkinter

What is this:
I made a graphical interactive program that allows users to create orders of products and store these in a MS SQL database environment.

The images are fetched locally (see folders) and user/item data is sent through prepared statements.

Requirements:
- Python 3
libraries (external):
- pyodbc
- pillow
